Ledger Wallet Android application


## Prerequisites:

Install Java 1.7 or later and set JAVA_HOME

Install Gradle and set GRADLE_HOME

Install Android SDK for API 22 (Lollipop 5.1.1) and set ANDROID_HOME

(You can omit all Atom images, Android Wear and Android TV stuff)


Through Android SDK manager:

Install Android support repository
Install Google Play Services
Install Google repository
Install Google USB driver


Download the package `android-support-v7-appcompat-master.zip` from https://github.com/haiqu/ledger-wallet-android/tree/master/app and extract it somewhere. Copy the two jar files from the libs directory to ledger-wallet-android/app/libs



## Building:

At the command prompt, type `gradlew.bat build` . If using Git Gui use `./gradlew build`

If you get an unexpected warning related to gradle_daemon and not being able to reserve enough memory space, edit gradle.properties and change `-Xmx2048m` to `-Xmx1024m` . This happens in 32-bit Windows due to an OS limit of 3GB total physical memory.
